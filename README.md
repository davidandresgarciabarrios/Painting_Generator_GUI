# 🎨 Damien Hirst Spot Paintings Generator

Welcome to the **Damien Hirst Spot Paintings Generator**! This small Python project creates randomized spot paintings inspired by the renowned artist Damien Hirst using the Turtle graphics library.

## 🌟 Features

- **Color Extraction:** Uses `colorgram.py` to extract a palette of colors from any image.
- **Randomized Art:** Generates a grid of spots with randomly selected colors.
- **Turtle Graphics:** Leverages the Turtle library for graphical rendering.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Place your image (e.g., `Painting.jpg`) in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python spot_paintings.py
    ```
3. Enjoy your generated spot painting!

## 📷 Example Output

Here's an example of the kind of artwork this script can generate:

## 🖌️ How It Works

The script extracts colors from an image to create a list of RGB values. It then sets up a Turtle graphics screen and draws a grid of spots, each filled with a randomly chosen color from the list.
